The AnimationCurve class is a core component of Unity's Animation System.
To construct a simple AnimationCurve through code, use one of the following static utility methods:
- Use AnimationCurve.EaseInOut for a curve that smoothly transitions from one value to another.
- Use AnimationCurve.Linear for a curve that linearly transitions from one value to another.
- Use AnimationCurve.Constant for a curve that holds a constant value over its duration.
To construct a complex AnimationCurve, use AnimationCurve.AnimationCurve and AnimationCurve.AddKey.Once constructed, use an AnimationCurve to animate the following properties:
- The GameObject position, rotation, scale, or component properties in an AnimationClip.
- The properties of ParticleSystem or VisualEffect.
- The properties of your own MonoBehaviour over time.
The following example illustrates how to use an AnimationCurve to gradually change the intensity of a Light.

Condition that determines if a transition is taken.
Animator conditions represent a comparison between an animator parameter and a threshold value.
When a condition is assigned to a transition, the animator evaluates the condition to determine if the transition is taken.
When the condition is true, the transition is taken.A condition is made of three parts: a comparison mode, a parameter name, and a threshold. The parameter is compared to the threshold using the comparison. The parameter is always to the left of the comparison.
For example, a condition with a comparison of Greater evaluates to true if the parameter is greater than the threshold.Not all parameter types are compatible with every comparison modes. If you attempt to use a parameter type with an incompatible comparison mode, an error occurs. Parameters types and their compatible comparison modes are as follows:
- For float parameters, the Greater and Less modes are compatible.
- For int parameters, the Greater, Less, Equals, and NotEquals modes are compatible.
- For boolean parameters, the If and IfNot modes are compatible.
- For trigger parameters, the If mode is compatible.
Note that when the comparison mode is If or IfNot, the threshold value is ignored.The following example adds a menu that creates a state machine in the Editor. It uses animator conditions to control when a transition is taken.

Animator Override Controller is used to override Animation Clips from a controller to specialize animations for a given Avatar.

1. Create an Animator Override Controller in the Editor.
2. Change one Animation Clip per frame at runtime (Basic use case).
In this case the indexer operator AnimatorOverrideController.this[string] could be used, but be careful as each call will trigger a reallocation of the animator's clip bindings.
3. Changing many Animation Clips per frame at runtime (Advanced use case).

The AnimatorOverrideController.ApplyOverrides method is well suited for this case as it reduce the number of animator's clips bindings reallocation to only one per call.

A body that forms part of a Physics articulation.
An articulation is a set of bodies arranged in a logical tree. The parent-child link in this tree reflects that the bodies have their relative motion constrained. Articulations are solved by a Featherstone solver that works in reduced coordinates - that is each body has relative coordinates to its parent but only along the unlocked degrees of freedom. This guarantees there is no unwanted stretch.
Like with regular Joints, there are two anchors for each pair of connected articulation bodies. One anchor is defined in the parent body's reference frame, whereas the other one is defined in the child's reference frame. Changing the constraints, you directly affect the allowed space for relative positions of the two anchors. For instance, ArticulationDofLock.LockedMotion will not allow any relative motion at all.

API for accessing the content of AssetBundle files.
This class exposes an API, via static methods, for loading and managing AssetBundles.This same class offers non-static methods and properties that expose the contents of a specific loaded AssetBundle, including the ability to load an Asset from within an AssetBundle.Create AssetBundles by calling BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles or using the Addressables package.
The build process generates one or more AssetBundle files, and each AssetBundle file contains a serialized instance of this class.Additional resources: Intro to AssetBundles, UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle, BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.
Scenes inside AssetBundles
- An AssetBundle can contain scenes or assets, but not a mix of both types.
- AssetBundle.LoadAsset, and the other Load methods, do not support loading scenes from AssetBundles.
- Scenes can be loaded from AssetBundles using the SceneManager.  When running in the Player, or Play mode in the Editor, first load the AssetBundle containing scenes.  Then call SceneManager.LoadScene or SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync with the scene path or name.
- When the Editor is in Edit mode, it does not support loading scenes from AssetBundles. Calls to EditorSceneManager.OpenScene with the path of a scene inside a loaded AssetBundle fail and log an error stating that the scene file is not found.

Although this is the base class for all asset importers, the recommended best practice is that you derive from the ScriptedImporter class if you want to write a new, custom importer.Each asset imported into the project is linked to a corresponding asset importer object. This object provides access to the settings applied during the asset import process. These settings are stored in the .meta file, are located adjacent to the source asset file. They encompass asset bundle information, custom user data, and any external objects upon which the asset relies.To obtain the asset importer object associated with an asset, use the AssetImporter.GetAtPath method.To apply and save any changes made to the settings, use the AssetImporter.SaveAndReimport method. This action reimports the asset with the updated configuration.The following example iterates through all assets within the project, identifying those that lack an asset bundle name by examining their respective asset importer objects.

You must create an Avatar to use with humanoid animation. If there is no Avatar on a character
with generic animation, an Avatar internal to the Animator is created instead.
Normally, the Avatar is created by the ModelImporter, but it can be created manually with AvatarBuilder
or through the "Build Generic Avatar" menu item of the Animator context menu.Generic AvatarFor generic animation, use AvatarBuilder.BuildGenericAvatar to specify what is the root of the animated
hierarchy (This can be nested in the hierarchy of the Animator) and the name of the node that holds the
root motion animation.Human AvatarFor humanoid animation, use AvatarBuilder.BuildHumanAvatar to specify what is the root of the animated
hierarchy (this can be nested in the hierarchy of the Animator) and the HumanDescription that provides
the mapping of transforms to human bones.Additional resources: Animator.avatar, AvatarBuilder, HumanDescription, ModelImporter.

/**
BillboardAsset describes how a billboard is rendered.
Billboards are a level-of-detail (LOD) method of drawing complicated 3D objects in a simpler manner if they are further away. Because the object is further away, there is often less requirement to draw the object at full detail due to its size on-screen and low likelihood of being a focal point in the Camera view. Instead, the object can be pre-rendered to a texture, and this texture used on a very simple Camera-facing Mesh of flat geometry (often simply a quadrilateral) known as a billboard. At great distances an object does not significantly change its orientation relative to the camera, so a billboard looks much like the object it represents from frame to frame, without having to be redrawn from the model. The BillboardAsset class allows the creation of billboards that are rendered from several directions, allowing a BillboardAsset to efficiently represent an object at low level of detail from any approximately-horizontal viewpoint.A BillboardAsset is usually created by importing SpeedTree assets. You can also create your own once you know how the billboard is described.SpeedTree billboard geometry is usually more complex than a plain quadrilateral. By using more vertices to cut out the empty part of the billboard image, rendering performance can potentially be improved due to the graphics system not having to draw as many redundant transparent pixels. You have access to the geometry data via BillboardAsset.vertices and BillboardAsset.indices.All vertices are considered in UV-space, because the geometry is due to be textured by the billboard images. UV vertices are easily expanded to 3D-space vertices by knowing the billboard's width, height, bottom, and what direction the billboard is currently facing. Assuming we have a billboard located at (0,0,0) looking at negative Z axis, the 3D-space coordinates are calculated as:X = (u - 0.5) * width
Y = v * height + bottom
Z = 0
UV-space vertices are expanded to 3D-space vertices, with a SpeedTree billboard at (0, 0, 0) in 3D space.In order to display something similar to the real 3D mesh being billboarded, SpeedTree billboards select an appropriate image from several pre-rendered images according to the current view direction.
The eight SpeedTree billboard images are baked. The images are created by capturing the rendered image of the 3D tree at different view angles, evenly distributed around the Y-axis. The first image always starts at positive X axis direction (or 0° if you imagine a unit circle from above).All images should be atlased together in one single texture. Each image is represented as a Vector4 of {left u, top v, width in u, height in v} in the atlas. You have access to all the images via BillboardAsset.imageTexCoords. SpeedTree Modeler always exports a normal texture alongside the diffuse texture for even better approximation of the lighting, and it shares the same atlas layout with the diffuse texture.Once the BillboardAsset is constructed, use BillboardRenderer to render it.

A canvas group can be used to modify the state of children elements.An example of this would be a window which fades in over time, by modifying the alpha value of the group the children elements will be affected. The result alpha will be the multiplied result of any nested groups, multiplied with the canvas elements alpha.You can configure Canvas Groups to not block raycasts. When you configure a Canvas Group to not block raycasts, graphic raycasting ignores anything in the group.Let's say you have a Canvas GameObject with a CanvasGroup component on it, and you set the CanvasGroup component's alpha to 0. In that case, the Canvas does not render any of its child GameObjects.
Now suppose that the Canvas also has a child CanvasGroup GameObject that you do want to render. If you enable IgnoreParentGroups for the CanvasGroup GameObject, the parent Canvas does not render any of its child GameObjects, including the CanvasGroup you want to render.
To get the child CanvasGroup GameObject, do one of two things:
In the parent Canvas, set the CanvasGroup component's alpha to a small, non-zero value.
Add a Canvas component to the child CanvasGroup GameObject that you want to render.

/**
Class for handling Cubemap arrays.
Modern graphics APIs (e.g. D3D10.1 and later, OpenGL 4.0 and later, Metal on macOS, PS4) support "cubemap arrays",
which are arrays of same size & format cubemaps. From the shader side, they are treated as a single resource, and sampling
them needs an extra coordinate that indicates which array element to sample from.Typically cubemap arrays are useful for implementing efficient reflection probe, lighting and shadowing systems
(all reflection/cookie/shadow cubemaps in a single array).Cubemap arrays do not have an import pipeline for them, and must be created from code, either at runtime or in editor
scripts. Using Graphics.CopyTexture is useful for fast copying of pixel data from regular Cubemap textures into
elements of a cubemap array. From editor scripts, a common way of creating serialized cubemap array is to create it,
fill with data (either via Graphics.CopyTexture from regular cubemaps, or via SetPixels or
SetPixels32) and save it as an asset via AssetDatabase.CreateAsset.Note that not all platforms and GPUs support cubemap arrays. Use SystemInfo.supportsCubemapArrayTextures to check. Also, this class does not support CubemapArray creation with a Crunch compression TextureFormat.

Unlike all other Collider2D which are defined indirectly by controlling geometric parameters such as the size of a Box or the radius of a Circle, here the CustomCollider2D is defined entirely by adding, removing and modifying PhysicsShape2D. This results in a fully customized Collider2D containing an unlimited number of low-level PhysicsShape2D which can represent any type of shape or shapes, or emulate any other existing Collider2D such as the CircleCollider2D, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, EdgeCollider2D, CompositeCollider2D or TilemapCollider2D.Alongside the customized geometry, there is full support for all existing Collider2D functionality such as triggers, physics materials, queries  etc.When assigning PhysicsShape2D to the CustomCollider2D, you can do so either during Edit mode or Play mode.When modifying the CustomCollider2D during Edit mode, all assigned PhysicsShape2D and associated vertices will be saved with the Unity Scene. When the Unity Scene is loaded again, the CustomCollider2D will maintain its configuration. In this way, it acts like any other Collider2D that you make changes to during Edit mode. Using this ability, Edit mode authoring scripts can be used to create custom geometry.When modifing the CustomCollider2D during Play mode, all assigned PhysicsShape2D and associated vertices will be lost when exiting Play mode. This acts like any other Collider2D.

/**
This class allows you to modify the Editor Build Settings via script.
EditorBuildSettings is stored in ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset. Typically this file should be included in source control.Scene ListThe ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset file contains the global scene list, which defines scenes to be included in the Player build.
This list can be overridden by the active BuildProfile.  For more information see Override settings with build profiles.Config ObjectsEditorBuildSettings can be used to persist references to configuration objects.In this context a config object is an asset, typically a ScriptableObject, that contains configuration settings.
The objects listed in EditorBuildSettings are not automatically included in the build, making them ideal for editor-only settings.
These assets could be accessed by custom build scripts, build callbacks, or any other script running in the editor.API for working with config objects:
- EditorBuildSettings.AddConfigObject
- EditorBuildSettings.RemoveConfigObject
- EditorBuildSettings.TryGetConfigObject
- EditorBuildSettings.GetConfigObjectNames
Config Object Example

Consider a package with a ScriptableObject-derived class for quality settings.
You can customize these settings and create multiple assets, with different values for various contexts.
Use EditorBuildSettings.AddConfigObject to track which asset should be considered as the "active" setting, marked by a distinctive name.
Then a build callback reads settings for the active quality settings by calling EditorBuildSettings.TryGetConfigObject with the designated name.Note: A similar feature is available for config objects that need to be included in the Player build, making them accessible to scripts running in the Player.  See PlayerSettings.SetPreloadedAssets and PlayerSettings.GetPreloadedAssets.Additional resources: EditorBuildSettingsScene, EditorUserBuildSettings, BuildPlayerOptions, SceneManager, IPreprocessBuildWithReport.

User build settings for the Editor
EditorUserBuildSettings tracks the build configuration for Player or AssetBundles builds.
For example, the active build target is used to determine which platform the Player is built for.This class is used to store build-related settings that are local to the project, as installed on a specific device.
For example, EditorUserBuildSettings.activeBuildTarget is a setting that could have different values for different people who are using the same Unity project and simultaneously building the Player for different devices.EditorUserBuildSettings is stored in Library/EditorUserBuildSettings.asset, a location which is not intended for inclusion in version control.
Some of these settings can be overridden by the active BuildProfile, see Override settings with build profiles for details.When writing a custom build script it is possible to retrieve the current settings using this class, or to provide different settings, see BuildPlayerOptions and BuildAssetBundlesParameters.The related class EditorBuildSettings exposes build-related settings that are suitable to be backed up and shared through version control.

/**
Base class for all objects that can exist in a scene. Add components to a GameObject to control its appearance and behavior.
The GameObject is the fundamental object type in Unity. Use GameObject to represent everything in your project, including characters, props, and scenery. A GameObject acts as a container for functional components that determine how the GameObject looks and behaves.Any script that derives from MonoBehaviour can be added to a GameObject as a component. Use the Component.gameObject property from your MonoBehaviour code to access the GameObject the component is attached to.MonoBehaviour event functions such as the regular per-frame MonoBehaviour.Update allow you to make the object responsive to events. To receive these event callbacks the GameObject must be active in the scene, which means both the activeSelf and activeInHierarchy properties must be true.You can create an empty GameObject from code by invoking one of the constructors. However, a more common method is to instantiate a GameObject in Prefab form, with preconfigured components, property values, and child objects. For more information, refer to Instantiating Prefabs at runtime in the Manual.You can modify many of the properties of this class in the Editor using the Inspector window. For a more comprehensive guide to using the GameObject class, refer to GameObject in the Manual.The following example creates a GameObject named "myExampleGO" and adds a component of type AudioSource:

A keyframe that can be injected into an AnimationCurve.
Keyframes are used to control how the value of an AnimationCurve changes over time. Each Keyframe is determined by its position in the AnimationCurve through the Keyframe.time (horizontal axis) and Keyframe.value (vertical axis) properties. You can control how interpolation is handled between different Keyframes and the AnimationCurve slopes through the Keyframe.inTangent, Keyframe.outTangent, Keyframe.weightedMode, Keyframe.inWeight and Keyframe.outWeight properties. Note that unlike what the Keyframe.time property name might imply, it is not actually tied to time and can simply be thought of as a position on the horizontal axis of a two-dimensional space. Hermite Segment            When both keyframes weightedMode are set to
            WeightedMode.None, the curve segment is interpolated using a Hermite curve algorithm.
            Hermite evaluates faster than Bezier and is the default weightedMode for a
            Keyframe. Bezier Segment            Setting weightedMode will change how the neighbouring segments are
            interpolated. Weighted segments are interpolated using a Bezier curve algorithm. For a given weighted
            keyframe, the interpolating function uses the Keyframe.outWeight value and the next keyframe’s
            Keyframe.inWeight alongside both keyframes values to calculate the curve. If no
            weight is set (when either keyframe Keyframe.weightedMode is set to WeightedMode.None),
            then a weight value of 1/3 is used.            Additional resources: AnimationCurve.AddKey, AnimationCurve.keys, AnimationCurve.Evaluate.

The Light Probe Proxy Volume component offers the possibility to use higher resolution lighting for large non-static GameObjects.
By default, a probe-lit Renderer receives lighting from a single Light Probe that is interpolated from the surrounding Light Probes in the Scene. Because of this, GameObjects have constant ambient lighting regardless of their position on the surface. The light has have a rotational gradient because it's using spherical harmonics, but it lacks a spatial gradient. This is more noticeable on larger GameObjects and Particle Systems. The lighting across the GameObject matches the lighting at the anchor point, and if the GameObject straddles a lighting gradient, parts of the GameObject will look incorrect.This component will generate a 3D grid of interpolated Light Probes inside a bounding volume. The resolution of the grid can be user-specified. The spherical harmonics coefficients of the interpolated Light Probes are updated into 3D textures, which are sampled at render time to compute the contribution to the diffuse ambient lighting. This adds a spatial gradient to probe-lit GameObjects.Additional resources: Light Probes.

/**
A class that allows you to create or modify meshes.
Meshes contain vertices and multiple triangle arrays.Conceptually, all vertex data is stored in separate arrays of the same size. For example, if you have
a mesh of 100 Vertices, and want to have a position, normal and two texture coordinates
for each vertex, then the mesh should have vertices, normals, uv and uv2
arrays, each being 100 in size. Data for i-th vertex is at index "i" in each array.For every vertex there can be a vertex position, normal, tangent, color and up to 8 texture coordinates.
Texture coordinates most often are 2D data (Vector2), but it is possible to make them
Vector3 or Vector4 if needed. This is most often used for holding arbitrary data in mesh
vertices, for special effects used in shaders. For skinned meshes, the vertex data can also
contain boneWeights.The mesh face data, i.e. the triangles it is made of, is simply three vertex indices for each triangle.
For example, if the mesh has 10 triangles, then the triangles array should be 30 numbers,
with each number indicating which vertex to use. The first three elements in the triangles array are
the indices for the vertices that make up that triangle; the second three elements make up
another triangle and so on.Note that while triangle meshes are the most common use case, Unity also supports other
mesh topology types, for example Line or Point meshes. For line meshes, each line
is composed of two vertex indices and so on. See SetIndices and MeshTopology.
Simple vs Advanced Mesh APIThe Mesh class has two sets of methods for assigning data to a Mesh from script. The "simple" set of methods provide a basis for setting the indices, triangle, normals, tangents, etc. These methods include validation checks, for example to ensure that you are not passing in data that would include out-of-bounds indices. They represent the standard way to assign Mesh data from script in Unity.The "simple" methods are: SetColors, SetIndices, SetNormals, SetTangents, SetTriangles, SetUVs, SetVertices, SetBoneWeights.There is also an "advanced" set of methods, which allow you to directly write to the mesh data with control over whether any checks or validation should be performed. These methods are intended for advanced use cases which require maximum performance. They are faster, but allow you to skip the checks on the data you supply. If you use these methods you must make sure that you are not supplying invalid data, because Unity will not check for you.The "advanced" methods are: SetVertexBufferParams, SetVertexBufferData, SetIndexBufferParams, SetIndexBufferData, SetSubMesh, and you can use the MeshUpdateFlags to control which checks or validation are performed or omitted. Use AcquireReadOnlyMeshData to take a read-only snapshot of Mesh data that you can use with C# Jobs and Burst, and AllocateWritableMeshData with ApplyAndDisposeWritableMeshData to create Meshes from C# Jobs and Burst.Manipulating meshes from a scriptThere are three common tasks that might want to use the Mesh API for:1. Building a mesh from scratch:
should always be done in the following order:
a) Assign vertices
b) Assign triangles.
2. Modifying vertex attributes every frame:
a) Get vertices
b) Modify them
c) Assign them back to the mesh.
3. Continously changing the mesh triangles and vertices:
a) Call Clear to start fresh
b) Assign vertices and other attributes
c) Assign triangle indices.It is important to call Clear before assigning new vertices or triangles. Unity always checks the supplied triangle indices whether they don't reference out of bounds vertices.
Calling Clear then assigning vertices then triangles makes sure you never have out of bounds data.

/**
MonoBehaviour is a base class that many Unity scripts derive from.
MonoBehaviour offers life cycle functions that make it easier to develop with Unity.MonoBehaviours always exist as a Component of a GameObject, and can be instantiated with GameObject.AddComponent.  Objects that need to exist independently of a GameObject should derive from ScriptableObject instead.A MonoBehaviour can be deleted with Object.Destroy or Object.DestroyImmediate.  When the parent GameObject is destroyed all components are automatically deleted, including MonoBehaviours.After the underlying component is destroyed, the C# object for the MonoBehaviour remains in memory until garbage is collected. A MonoBehaviour in this state acts as if it is null. For example, it returns true for a "obj == null" check.
However, this class doesn't support the null-conditional operator  (?.) and the null-coalescing operator (??).When a MonoBehaviour is serialized, the value of C# fields are included according to Unity's Serialization rules. See Script Serialization for details.
The serialized data also includes internal properties, such as the reference to the MonoScript that tracks the implementation class for the object.For code samples, see the individual MonoBehaviour methods.Note: In the Editor, when the MonoBehaviour component is deactivated through the checkbox in the Inspector, it stops receiving calls to its Event functions.Additional resources: The Deactivating GameObjects page in the manual.

Specify which of the temporary data generated while building the NavMesh should be retained in memory after the process has completed.
It is possible to collect and display in the Editor the intermediate data used in the process of building the navigation mesh using the NavMeshBuilder. This can help with diagnosing those situations when the resulting NavMesh isn’t of the expected shape.
Input Geometry, Regions, Polygonal Mesh Detail and Raw Contours shown after building the NavMesh with debug optionsThe process for computing a NavMesh comprises of several sequential steps:
i. decomposing the Scene's terrain and meshes into triangles;
ii. rasterizing the input triangles into a 3D voxel representation and finding ledges;
iii. partitioning the voxels lying at the surface into simpler horizontal regions;
iv. finding a tight-fitting contour for each of these regions;
v. simplifying the contours into polygonal shapes;
vi. creating a mesh of convex polygons based on all the contours combined;
vii. refining the polygonal mesh into a triangulated version that approximates better the Scene's original geometry.Through the use of the debug functionality the results from each stage can be captured and displayed separately, whereas normally they would get discarded when the NavMesh construction is completed.Depending on the Scene composition this debug data can be considerably large in size. It is stored in memory in a compressed manner but gets further expanded when being displayed.Notes:

An obstacle for NavMeshAgents to avoid.
A NavMeshObstacle is cylindrical in shape and can move around the surface of the NavMesh with a specified velocity. By default, the obstacle will only affect the agent's avoidance behaviour rather than the pathfinding. This means that the agent will ignore the obstacle when plotting a path but will sidestep around it while moving along the path. If carving is enabled, the obstacle will create a temporary "hole" in the NavMesh. The hole will be recognised by the pathfinding, so paths will be plotted to avoid the obstacle. This means that if, say, an obstacle blocks a narrow gap, the pathfinding will seek an alternative route to the target. Without carving, the agent will head for the gap but won't be able to pass until the obstacle is clear.Additional resources: NavMeshAgent.

/**
An extension to the BuildReport class that tracks how Assets contribute to the size of the build.
The build process generates a PackedAssets object for each Serialized File, resS and resource file generated by a build.  Serialized Files contain serialized Unity Objects from scenes and assets.The PackedAsset information can be used to analyze how specific assets or types contribute to the size of the build, for example to calculate the total size of all textures.Example file names for Serialized Files in the output of a Player build are resources.assets, sharedassets0.assets and globalgamemanagers.assets.
Note: The content of scenes in the output of a Player build are written to Serialized Files with the names level0, level1, level2 etc.
However there are no PackedAsset objects generated for level files, nor for the globalgamemanager file.AssetBundles containing assets will have a single Serialized File, with a name like "CAB-b8befc517982290c55526f35cbb7f03d".  AssetBundles containing scenes will contain multiple Serialized Files.The PackedAssets for a Serialized File records the size of the header in the overhead property, and then information about each object in the contents property.Files with the .resource contain audio or video data which is referenced by an AudioClip or VideoClip object inside the associated Serialized File.
For example level1.resource contains audio and video data from objects inside the Serialized File level1.
The PackedAsset for a .resource file records information about the originating asset for each blob of audio or video data in the .resource file.Similarly, the PackedAsset object for a .resS file records information about the size and origin of Texture and Mesh data inside the file.Note: For large builds the PackedAsset objects can grow very large, and consume a significant amount of memory.  When using this data it is recommended to do a single pass through the data to populate smaller data structures or to export it to another format, as required by external tools.Additional resources: PackedAssetInfo

/**
Script interface for the Built-in Particle System. Unity's powerful and versatile particle system implementation.
General parameters

The Particle System's general parameters are kept inside a special Main module. These parameters are visible in the Inspector above all the other modules.In script, these parameters are accessible through ParticleSystem.main.Accessing module propertiesParticle System properties are grouped by the module they belong to, such as ParticleSystem.noise and ParticleSystem.emission. These properties are structs, but do not behave like normal C# structs. They are simply interfaces directly into the native code, so it is important to know how to use them, compared to a normal C# struct.The key difference is that it is not necessary to assign the struct back to the Particle System component. When you set any property on a module struct, Unity immediately assigns that value to the Particle System.Also, because each module is a struct, you must cache it in a local variable before you can assign any new values to the module. For example, instead of:
ParticleSystem.emission.enabled = true;    // Doesn't compile
write:
var emission = ParticleSystem.emission;    // Stores the module in a local variable
emission.enabled = true;    // Applies the new value directly to the Particle SystemModule effect multipliersEvery module has special multiplier properties that allow you to change the overall effect of a curve without having to edit the curve itself. These multiplier properties are all named after the curve they affect - for instance ParticleSystem.emission.rateMultiplier controls the overall effect of ParticleSystem.emission.rate in a given system.Constant value shorthandParameters support a shorthand notation for simple constant values. To set a constant value for a parameter, all you need to do is assign a number to it. It is not necessary to create a MinMaxCurve or MinMaxGradient object in the ParticleSystemCurveMode.Constant mode.For example, instead of:
var emission = ParticleSystem.emission;
emission.rate = new ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve(5.0f);
write:
var emission = ParticleSystem.emission;
emission.rate = 5.0f;Performance note: When setting properties on particle modules, the settings are passed immediately into native code. This gives the best performance. This means that setting properties on a module struct doesn't set something in script that requires setting back to the Particle System; it all happens automatically.Additional resources: Particle.

Script interface for Particle System Force Fields.
Particle System Force Fields can be used to influence groups of particles that enter each field's zone of influence.The shape of the Force Field can be set to a variety of shapes, and how the particles are affected is controlled by various properties in the Force Field.As part of choosing the shape, you may define a start and end range. The end range describes the maximum extent of the shape, and the start range can be used to create a hollow shape.A number of forces can be applied to particles that are within this volume: directional, gravitational, rotational, drag, and a vector field.The settings for each type of force make use of the MinMaxCurve type, which is also used in the Particle System. This type allows you to set simple uniform values, or more complicated values that vary per-particle, and vary over the lifetime of each particle.

/**
A set of options that control how physics operates when using the job system to multithread the physics simulation.
Multithreaded physics is currently an experimental feature. As such, many options are exposed that allow performance configuration that may not be available when the feature moves out of experimental status.A physics simulation executes in the following discrete stages:• Find New Contacts
• Contact Collision
• Discrete Solver (Clear Island Flags -> Discrete Island Traversal -> Discrete Island Solver -> Synchronize Fixtures -> Find New Contacts)
• Continuous Solver (Clear Island Flags > Continuous Island Traversal -> Discrete Island Solver -> Synchronize Fixtures -> Find New Contacts)
• Clear Body Forces
• Update Trigger ContactsThese stages execute in the order given above. Each stage is run as a job "task". Each task executes sub job tasks, which are shown in parenthesis above. When executing a job, physics simulation may process bodies, contacts, joints, and so on, across multiple job threads. You can task each of these threads with executing a specific number of items, such as bodies, contacts and joints. Many of the options provided here allow you to control the minimum number of items assigned to each job. Raising the minimum can reduce the number of jobs required. This is because running a lot of jobs, each processing only a few items, is usually not very efficient. The default settings provide a decent performance to job balance, however you are free to experiment.Additionally, prior to the simulation being run, Rigidbody2D interpolation/extrapolation poses are stored ready for per-frame interpolation/extrapolation.  These are also executed using the job system and are controlled here.

/**
Controls playback of Playable objects.
The PlayableDirector is primarily used by the Timeline Package to handle bindings to scene objects and control playback of the PlayableGraph.
The PlayableDirector object builds a PlayableGraph from a PlayableAsset. Once the graph is built, use the PlayableDirector to manage playback of the graph's Playable. To control playback of the PlayableGraph, use:
- PlayableDirector.Play
- PlayableDirector.Stop
- PlayableDirector.Pause
- PlayableDirector.Resume
To be notified of playback state changes, subscribe to:
- PlayableDirector.played
- PlayableDirector.paused
- PlayableDirector.stopped
To handle references between assets and scene objects, PlayableDirector implements IExposedPropertyTable. To set or get bindings, use:
- PlayableDirector.SetGenericBinding
- PlayableDirector.GetGenericBinding
Multiple PlayableDirectors can reference the same PlayableAsset. When this occurs, each PlayableDirector creates its own independent PlayableGraph with its own scene bindings.
The following example demonstrates how to use the Playable Director to bind scene objects to assets and how to control the Playable Graph.

/**
Render textures are textures that can be rendered to.
They can be used to implement image based rendering effects, dynamic shadows,
projectors, reflections or surveillance cameras.One typical usage of render textures is setting them as the "target texture" property
of a Camera (Camera.targetTexture), this will make a camera render into a texture
instead of rendering to the screen.Keep in mind that render texture contents can become "lost" on certain events, like loading a new level, system going to a screensaver mode, in and out of fullscreen and so on.
When that happens, your existing render textures will become "not yet created" again,
you can check for that with IsCreated function.As with other "native engine object" types, it is important to pay attention to the lifetime of
any render textures and release them when you are finished using them with the Release function,
as they will not be garbage collected like normal managed types.A render texture only has a data representation on the GPU and you need to use Texture2D.ReadPixels to transfer its contents to CPU memory.The initial contents of a newly created render texture are undefined. On some platforms and APIs the contents will default to black, but you shouldn't depend on this. You can use LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings to highlight undefined areas of the display, to help you debug rendering problems in your built application.Additional resources: Camera.targetTexture.

/**
Control of an object's position through physics simulation.
Adding a Rigidbody component to an object will put its motion under the control of Unity's physics engine. Even without adding any code, a Rigidbody object will be pulled downward by gravity and will react to collisions with incoming objects if the right Collider component is also present.The Rigidbody also has a scripting API that lets you apply forces to the object and control it in a physically realistic way. For example, a car's behaviour can be specified in terms of the forces applied by the wheels. Given this information, the physics engine can handle most other aspects of the car's motion, so it will accelerate realistically and respond correctly to collisions.In a script, the FixedUpdate function is recommended as the place to apply forces and change Rigidbody settings (as opposed to Update, which is used for most other frame update tasks). The reason for this is that physics updates are carried out in measured time steps that don't coincide with the frame update. FixedUpdate is called immediately before each physics update and so any changes made there will be processed directly.A common problem when starting out with Rigidbodies is that the game physics appears to run in "slow motion". This is actually due to the scale used for your models. The default gravity settings assume that one world unit corresponds to one metre of distance. With non-physical games, it doesn't make much difference if your models are all 100 units long but when using physics, they will be treated as very large objects. If a large scale is used for objects that are supposed to be small, they will appear to fall very slowly - the physics engine thinks they are very large objects falling over very large distances. With this in mind, be sure to keep your objects more or less at their scale in real life (so a car should be about 4 units = 4 metres, for example).

A representation of the Animator Controller, optimized for runtime.
At runtime, Unity replaces the AnimatorController class with this optimized runtime class. Access to Editor functions, such as modifying the structure of an Animator Controller, are restricted.This optimized class provides the following different ways to access and modify an Animator Controller at runtime:
- Store the reference of an Animator Controller so you can replace the Animator Controller of an Animator. This is useful for modifiying the structure of an Animator Controller at runtime. Use Animator.runtimeAnimatorController to access the controller to be replaced.
- Create an AnimatorOverrideController that you can use to override the Animation Clips associated with an Animator Controller. This is more efficient than replacing a controller because only the clips are updated. The Animator Override Controller is based on the Runtime Animator Controller that initializes it. Additional resources: AnimatorOverrideController.runtimeAnimatorController.
The following example demonstrates how to spawn GameObjects at runtime. Each GameObject is animated with different Animator Controllers.

shader variants are loaded at startup (or level load time), to avoid shader compilation related hiccups later on in the game.In Unity, many shaders internally have multiple "variants", to account for different light modes, lightmaps, shadows and so on. These variants are identified by a shader pass type, and a set of shader keywords. See ShaderVariant.Typical use of ShaderVariantCollection is to record the shader variants used during a play session from the editor (under Graphics Settings), save them out as an asset, and add to the list of preloaded shaders (again in Graphics Settings). Additionally, you could call WarmUp on a ShaderVariantCollection object manually.ShaderVariantCollection generally replaces the old Shader.WarmupAllShaders function.

/**
Adding a SortingGroup component to a GameObject will ensure that all Renderers within the GameObject's descendants will be sorted and rendered together.
A common use case for having a SortingGroup is to create complex 2D characters that are made up of multiple SpriteRenderers. When several clones of such a character overlap, their individual body parts might not be sorted properly resulting in a visual glitch where the the body parts interleave. For example, the hands of two characters might be sorted in front of their bodies, where you would expect one entire character to be drawn in front of the other character. The SortingGroup component solves this by ensuring the entire branch of the character are sorted and rendered together.The descendants of the SortingGroup are sorted using the same SortingLayer and Renderer.sortingOrder. However, they are only sorted against other descendants of the SortingGroup and not with any renderers outside of it. This allows you to reuse the same SortingLayers (for example, "Hands", "Torso"...) to sort body parts while ensuring they never interleave with other clones of the character.The SortingGroups, together with other renderers, are sorted using the SortingLayer and Renderer.sortingOrder. Additionally, they can be nested within other SortingGroups. This is useful if you have branches of descendants that should not be mixed up i.e. the "Left Hand" vs the "Right Hand" hierarchy branches.The maximum number of sorting groups and renderers is 4096.

Class for handling Sparse Textures.
Sparse textures are textures where not the whole texture data can be present in memory at once. They are also commonly called "tiled textures" or "mega textures".Imagine a 16384x16384 texture at 32 bits per pixel - it would take 1GB of memory. The texture is broken down into rectangular "tiles", and each tile can either be present in memory or not. You can load & unload these tiles as needed based on distance from the camera, sectors of the world that the player has to see, etc.Otherwise, the sparse textures behave just like any other texture in shaders - they can have mipmaps, can use all texture filtering modes, etc. If you happen to read from a tile that's not present, you can get undefined result (on many GPUs the result is a black color, but that's not guaranteed).Not all hardware and platforms support sparse textures, so you should check SystemInfo.supportsSparseTextures before using them. For example, on DirectX systems they require DX11.2 (Windows 8.1) and a fairly recent GPU; and on OpenGL they require ARB_sparse_texture extension support. Sparse textures only support non-compressed texture formats.After creating the sparse texture, query the tile size with tileWidth & tileHeight. Tile sizes are platform and GPU dependent.Use UpdateTile or UpdateTileRaw to make a tile resident in memory and update its color data. Use UnloadTile to unload a tile.Additional resources:  Sparse Textures.

/**
Sprite Atlas is an asset created within Unity. It is part of the built-in sprite packing solution.
A Sprite Atlas stores a list of packable assets. A packable asset is either a Sprite, Texture2D of TextureImporterType.Sprite or Folder. Before the packing process begins, these packable assets will be grouped and traversed to gather all the sprites from them. These will be used in the packing process. At runtime, these sprites can be enumerated via the Sprite Atlas (Additional resources: SpriteAtlas.GetSprites).It also provides dedicated texture settings in the inspector for the packed texture. The original texture settings of the sprite will have no effect on the packed texture.By default, Sprite Atlas will be referenced by the sprite and be available at runtime. This means that the sprite will be able to acquire the packed texture from the Sprite Atlas when loaded. A Sprite can be loaded without referencing any Sprite Atlas. A Sprite loaded this way will render as invisible since there is no texture. A reference to a Sprite Atlas can be added later. Additional resources: SpriteAtlasManager.Sprite Atlas variants can be created by assigning another Sprite Atlas object as the master. Variants will not repack a new texture from the packable list. Instead of this, variants will duplicate the master's packed texture and downscale it according to a user-defined ratio and save this scaled texture.

/**
Class for handling 2D texture arrays.
Modern graphics APIs (e.g. D3D10 and later, OpenGL ES 3.0 and later, Metal etc.) support "texture arrays", which is an array of same size & format textures.
From the shader side, they are treated as a single resource, and sampling them needs an extra coordinate that indicates which array element to sample from.Typically texture arrays are useful as an alternative for texture atlases, or in other cases where objects use a set of same-sized textures (e.g. terrains).Currently in Unity texture arrays do not have an import pipeline for them, and must be created from code, either at runtime or in editor scripts.
Using Graphics.CopyTexture is useful for fast copying of pixel data from regular 2D textures into elements of a texture array. From editor scripts,
a common way of creating serialized texture array is to create it, fill with data (either via Graphics.CopyTexture from regular 2D textures, or via SetPixels or
SetPixels32) and save it as an asset via AssetDatabase.CreateAsset.Note that not all platforms and GPUs support texture arrays; for example Direct3D9 does not. Use SystemInfo.supports2DArrayTextures to check. Also, this class does not support Texture2DArray creation with a Crunch compression TextureFormat.

/**
WheelFrictionCurve is used by the WheelCollider to describe friction properties of the wheel tire.
The curve takes a measure of tire slip as an input and gives a force as output. The curve is approximated by
a two-piece spline. The first section goes from (0,0) to (extremumSlip,extremumValue), at which
point the curve's tangent is zero. The second section goes from (extremumSlip,extremumValue)
to (asymptoteSlip,asymptoteValue), where curve's tangent is again zero:In the previous image a graph displays the wheel slip curve with force on the y-axis and slip on the x-axis. Force increases as slip increases up to the extremum point, after which force declines as slip increases up to the asymptote point. Beyond the asymptote the curve becomes a flat line as additional slip gives no further change in force.Wheel collider computes friction separately from the rest of physics engine, using a slip based
friction model. It separates the overall friction force into a "forwards" component (in the
direction of rolling, and responsible for acceleration and braking) and "sideways" component
(orthogonal to rolling, responsible for keeping the car oriented). Tire friction is described
separately in these directions using WheelCollider.forwardFriction and WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction.
In both directions it is first determined how much the tire is slipping (what is the speed difference between
the rubber and the road). Then this slip value is used to find out tire force exerted on the contact.The property of real tires is that for low slip they can exert high forces as the rubber compensates
for the slip by stretching. Later when the slip gets really high, the forces are reduced as the tire
starts to slide or spin. Thus tire friction curves have a shape like in the image above.Because the friction for the tires is computed separately, the PhysicsMaterial of the ground
does not affect the wheels. Simulation of different road materials is done by changing
the WheelCollider.forwardFriction and WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction of the wheel,
based on what material the wheel is hitting.Additional resources: WheelCollider, WheelCollider.forwardFriction, WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction.
